# Contributing to HO

Whether you are a novice or experienced software developer, all contributions and suggestions are welcome!
If you are looking to contribute to the HO codebase, the best place to start is the GitHub "issues" tab.
This is also a great place for filing bug reports and making suggestions for ways in which we can improve the code and documentation.

## Filing Issues

If you notice a bug in the code or in docs or have suggestions for how we can improve either, feel free to create an issue on the GitHub "issues" tab using GitHub's "issue" form. The form contains some questions that will help us best address your issue. For more information regarding how to file issues against pandas, please refer to the Bug reports and enhancement requests section of our main contribution doc.

## Getting Started

The code is hosted on GitHub, so you will need to use Git to clone the project and make changes to the codebase. 
It is also suggested to use IntelliJ IDEA as the main IDE. In case you decide to use Eclipse make sure to add all the relevant filters in the .ignore accordingly.


## Contributing to the Codebase

In case you are not familiar with project contribution on GitHub, we suggest you read first some [appropriate documentation](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
Before submitting your changes for review, make sure to pull latest vesrion of master and check that HO builds with your changes. 
Once your changes are ready to be submitted, make sure to push your changes to GitHub before creating a pull request. 
You will most likely be asked to make additional changes before it is finally ready to merge. 
However, once it's ready, we will merge it, and you will have successfully contributed to the codebase!
