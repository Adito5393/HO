## Development workflow

A single master branch record the history of the project.

To contribute features, you should clone the repository, create a tracking branch for develop and create the feature:

git clone https://github.com/akasolace/ho.git
git checkout -b some-feature develop

When the feature is ready, you can make a pull request to merge that feature into master. 


## Releases

When a release is ready, we fork a release branch from master.
